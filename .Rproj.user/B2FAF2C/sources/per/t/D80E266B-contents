Your API key for Giant Bomb is...

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

url  <- "http://api.epdb.eu"
path <- "eurlex/directory_code"
Executing an API call with the GET flavor is done using the GET() function.

raw.result <- GET(url = url, path = path)

```{r}
url  <- "https://www.giantbomb.com"
path <- "api/games/?api_key=c0d1c470c47b7e1e9968d69c748ea4eeba0acbcb&field_list=name,platforms&format=json"


raw.result <- GET(url = url, path = path)
```

```{r}
json_file <- fromJSON(raw.result$content)

json_file <- lapply(json_file, function(x) {
  x[sapply(x, is.null)] <- NA
  unlist(x)
})
```






```{r}
names(raw.result)
head(raw.result$content)
this.raw.content <- rawToChar(raw.result$content)
this.content <-fromJSON(this.raw.content, flatten = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#this should convert to dataframe, but alas, error? thanks for nothing, google
#this.content.df <- do.call(what = "rbind",
                          # args = lapply(this.content, as.data.frame))
```
Lets try to do it ourselves


```{r}
results<-this.content$results
head(results)
```

Ok, so - we get a dataframe with a column with game names I instantly want to know more about Bass Avenger. 
We also have a column for platforms, but this is a column of lists. Lists are tricky to work with and we will have to see if we can expand that to find out what platforms I can play Bass Avenger on. 

Heres the contents of  

```{r}
results$platform[5] 
```

Alright, awesome. I have *both* those platforms! I'll check out Bass Avenger on my own time. _Back to the data!_

```{r}
platforms<-results$platforms
```
